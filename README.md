### Stay away from subpar companies like CertiK, waste your time and cares shit about you

Here is the full-stack intern question, it wants you to immitate a webpage using React. The deadline is 7 days.

I completed this using a day and a half, when I asked is this okay and is there something needed to improve, the person said it's okay.

Then, another person came in, saying "this project cannot tell much about your coding ability, please use react to immitate a company home page".

After negotiation and their approval, I spent a few hours using python and did a cmd-version of ranking of company page score ranking to show my algorithm ability, and there was no message thereafter. They vanished like a fart in the wind.

This small stupid company is a sham, it wastes candidates time and showed no respect at all. Even it's a email rejection from normal companies, I got template letters, and it does not waste my time. Well for CertiK? Nothing, guess I am just too weak for their highness.

My personal suggestion is, stay away from CertiK as best as you can, and also **stay away from any task-based-interview companies**, they are mostly wasting your precious time and energy for other application, put it more simply they do not care about candidates, they are selfish bastards that only want to maximize their own interst. It would be disastrous if any company is like this.

Good luck to those of you in a job search! There are a tons of great companies out there :D
